1. Importing Regular Expressions:

import re: This line imports the re module, which provides functionalities for working with regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful patterns used for text matching and manipulation.
2. Defining Chatbot Responses:

responses = {...}: This line creates a dictionary named responses. Dictionaries store key-value pairs, where keys are used for retrieval and values are the actual data.
Each key in the dictionary is a regular expression pattern enclosed in raw strings (r'pattern').
The corresponding value for each key is the chatbot's response to the matched pattern.
The regular expressions are case-insensitive (e.g., 'hello|hi' matches both "hello" and "Hi").
The .* pattern matches anything not explicitly defined in the dictionary (more on this later).
3. Processing User Input Function:

def process_input(user_input):: This line defines a function named process_input that takes a string as input (user_input).
user_input = user_input.lower(): This line converts the user input to lowercase using lower(). This makes the chatbot's responses case-insensitive.
for pattern, response in responses.items(): This line iterates through each key-value pair in the responses dictionary.
pattern: This variable holds the current regular expression pattern being considered.
response: This variable holds the chatbot's response associated with the current pattern.
if re.match(pattern, user_input):: This line checks if the user input matches the current pattern using the re.match function.
re.match: This function attempts to match the pattern at the beginning of the string. If successful, it returns a match object, otherwise it returns None.
return response: If the pattern matches, the function returns the corresponding response from the dictionary.
return responses['.*']: If no match is found in the loop, the function returns the default response associated with the .* pattern in the dictionary. This pattern matches any string.
4. Chatbot Loop:

while True: This line creates a loop that continues indefinitely until it's broken.
user_input = input('You: '): This line prompts the user for input and stores it in the user_input variable.
response = process_input(user_input): This line calls the process_input function, passing the user input as an argument. The returned response is stored in the response variable.
print('Chatty:', response): This line prints the chatbot's response preceded by "Chatty: ".
if re.match(r'goodbye|bye', user_input.lower()):: This line checks if the user input matches either "goodbye" or "bye" (case-insensitive using lower()).
If there's a match, the loop is broken using break.
In summary, this code creates a simple chatbot named "Chatty" that can respond to various user inputs based on defined patterns. The chatbot loop repeatedly prompts for input, processes it using regular expressions, and provides a response. The default response is used for any unmatched input.
